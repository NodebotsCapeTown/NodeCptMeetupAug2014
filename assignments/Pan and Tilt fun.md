##Project ideas

###Find the closest object in the room.
	* Sweep the sensor across the room
	* Measure the distance using the Ping object
	* Stop if an object is closer than 1 meter

###Integrate it with Socket.io:
	* Display the distance in the browser
	* Control the panning and tilting from the browser using sliders
	* Measure the distance by clicking a button in the browser

And now do other whacky things... integrate it with the HTML5 canvas maybe.
